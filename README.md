# E-Commerce-Frontend

Welcome to the e-commerce frontend repository made with Vite, React, Redux, and Material UI for icons. This frontend communicates with the backend API hosted at `https://coral-app-ogkbu.ondigitalocean.app/`. The frontend is hosted on Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions.

To get started, make sure you have the latest version of Node.js installed on your system. Then, clone this repository and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server by running the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open your default browser with the application running on `http://localhost:5173`.

The project structure is organized in the following way:

- `src` directory contains all the source code for the application.
- `public` directory contains the HTML file and other static assets that are served as is.
- `store` directory contains the Redux store, actions, reducers, and types.
- `Components` directory contains all the React components used in the application.
- `Css` directory contains the CSS styles for the application.

The project uses React Router for routing and Material UI for icons. Redux is used for state management.

To build the application for production, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a production build of the application in the `dist` directory, which you can deploy to any static hosting platform.

Thank you for using our e-commerce frontend repository. If you have any questions or issues, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.
